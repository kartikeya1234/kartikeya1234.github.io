I am a former graduate researcher at TU Berlin and Zuse Institute Berlin, investigating the robustness of vision-language foundation models against adversarial attacks and spurious correlations. My work focuses on developing counterfactual and adversarial training methodologies to improve the reliability of multi-modal AI systems in safety-critical applications.
