I am looking for doctoral positions focused on adversarial machine learning. Till recently, I was a student research assistant at the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) in the [IOL](https://iol.zib.de) group, where I worked with [Shpresim Sadiku](http://shpresimsadiku.com) among others, and under the guidance of [Sebastian Pokutta](https://www.pokutta.com), I completed my Master's thesis. I earned an MSc in Scientific Computing from the [Techische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin), and a BSc in Physical Sciences from the [University of Delhi](https://www.du.ac.in).

### Research Interests
I am interested in Adversarial Machine Learning. I have worked on problems in the domain of three key research directions: 
- Adversarial robustness of multi-modal foundation models. 
- Transferbility of adversarial attacks. 
- Mitigation of spurious correlations through plausible counterfactuals.

### Recent Work
This master's thesis (click [link](https://robust-mmfm.com) for a demo) investigates the comparative effectiveness of sparse and non-sparse adversarial perturbations on multi-modal foundation models, with particular emphasis on vision-language architectures within the OpenFlamingo model family. The research demonstrates that both attack methodologies successfully compromised model integrity, eliciting outputs ranging from semantically incongruent captions to potentially harmful textual content in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning tasks.

Notably, the findings reveal that non-sparse adversarial attacks achieved superior performance relative to their sparse counterparts, even under conditions of minimal perturbation magnitude. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of training paradigms indicates that counterfactual-based training yielded marginally enhanced model robustness compared to adversarial training approaches, as evidenced by improved performance across image-text retrieval and image classification benchmarks spanning multiple datasets.
